        ## RC ##
        ## APPROACH : STACK ##
        ## LOGIC ##
        ## 1. Only 3 conditions, open brace -> push to stack
        ## 2. 2 close braces -> pop from stack, if you donot have enough open braces before increment count(indicates one open required)
        ## 3. Only 1 close brace found --> count + 1, to make it 2 close braces, if stack then just pop, if stack is empty then increment count by 2 (one for close brace, one for open brace)
        ## 4. If stack is still left with open braces, we require close braces = twice of that open braces in stack

        ## You can even optimize it, without using stack, just counting the left braces.

	## TIME COMPLEXITY : O(N) ##
	## SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1) ##

                if left_braces:
                    left_braces -= 1
                else:
                    count += 1                  # one open brace required
                i += 2
            elif s[i] == ")" and s[i+1] != ")":
                if left_braces:
                    count += 1                  # one close brace required
                    left_braces -= 1
                else:
                    count += 2                  # one open and one close brace required
